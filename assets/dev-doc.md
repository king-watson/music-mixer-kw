Research:

Based on the in class examples shown in class I have thought about how to implement my passion with this assignment. I have researched and hand pickked the most iconic goal horns in hockey. Songs that go together with the drag n drop feature we are to make during this task.

Java script allows you to drag n drop items using tags such as (dragstart) (dragover) (drop) these are needed to handle interactions.

Elements can be disabled or changed just by modifying the drag attribute or by adding css to it

postion: absoulute and relative can help arange dragging elements

Materials:

HTML need to create structure of my webpage
CSS to style and make my page look visual appealing
JS to add the drag n drop festure

Add drop zones in the areas where hockey players score 
Drag players from 4 different teams to play their goal horn 

Timeline:

1 finish up breaking down if I want to follow through with this idea
2 mock up what i want the background to look like. I know what I want just need to see it on a webpage. (HTML and CSS)
3 add drop areas and locations in proper spots
4 add instructions and title to webpage
5 for drop areas make elements to represent different teams and correspond audio files with the team
