# Music Mixer
This project is a collaborative effort to design and develop an interactive multimedia application that allows users to create dynamic audio experiences. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and motion tools, we will implement drag-and-drop functionality for loading audio clips, triggering animations, and playing compiled audio tracks. The project follows an agile workflow, structured in sprints to ensure an organized development process.
## Installation
For developers: Clone the repository and open the project in a local development environment.

For users: No installation is required. Just open index.html in a browser.
## Usage
Drag and Drop: Users can drag audio clips into designated areas to create a custom track.

Playback: Click the play button to listen to the compiled audio sequence.

Animations: Visual elements respond dynamically to user interactions, enhancing the experience.

Responsive Design: The application adapts to different screen sizes for an optimized experience.
